# Migrating from version 3.x to 4

`svelte-gantt` no longer requires `moment`. You can still use it as `MomentSvelteGanttDateAdapter`. All parameters that were previously moment objects became numbers (milliseconds since UNIX epoch).

ALL date parameters should be UNIX timestamps (JavaScript `Date` and `moment` objects will still work in most of the cases).

Date parameters can stay moment or JavaScript Date objects because they will be transformed to UNIX timestamps.

CSS is now injected so no need to include `svelteGantt.css` in your HTML.
